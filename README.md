# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
This workday scheduler displays the current date and time at the top of the calendar. To use the planner, notes or to-do items can be typed in each box next to corresponding times and saved with the "save" button on the right. Saved items will remain in the planner, even after refreshing the page, using local storage. Time blocks are color-coded with grey indicating time in the past, red indicating the current hour and green indicating future time in the day. This tool is excellent to map out each day to ensure maximum productivity and organization!
